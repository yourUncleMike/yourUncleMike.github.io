This &lt;p&gt;aragraph is just something to read while the browser hides and bolds other form elements, below.
All that hiding and bolding happens faster than the eye can detect, unless you save this page to disk and open the saved copy with Internet Explorer.
(That's because IE blocks JavaScript for local files until you click <button style="font-family: sans-serif" onclick="alert('Not the button you were looking for...')">Allow Blocked Content</button>.)

<h2>The <button disabled> + </button> and <button disabled> - </button> buttons affect the two page elements immediately following them:</h2>

<div>
 <button onclick="button_toggle(this)">-</button>&nbsp;
 <span>This &lt;span&gt; started out normal because the &lt;button&gt; to its left was <button disabled> - </button>.</span>
 <div>
  Also, this &lt;div&gt; started out visible because the &lt;button&gt; above was <button disabled> - </button>.
  <br>
  Clicking the <button disabled> - </button> &lt;button&gt; changes it to <button disabled> + </button> and hides this &lt;div&gt;.
  <br>
 </div>
</div>

<div>
 <button onclick="button_toggle(this)">+</button>&nbsp;
 <span>This &lt;span&gt; started out bolded because the &lt;button&gt; to its left was <button disabled> + </button>.</span>
 <div>
  This &lt;div&gt; started out hidden but was exposed when you clicked the <button disabled> + </button> &lt;button&gt;.<br>
  The &lt;button&gt; has now changed to <button disabled> - </button> and clicking it again will change it back and rehide this &lt;div&gt;.</div>
</div>

<p>Alternate Javascript-free approach:</p>
<details open>
 <summary>This is a <b>summary</b> element embedded within an outer <b>details</b> element.</summary>
 <div>
  This is the actual <i>content</i> of the <b>details</b> element.
  It is located between the closing <b>&lt;/summary&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;/details&gt;</b> tags.
  It started out exposed because its <b>details</b> element included the <b>open</b> attribute.
  <details>
   <summary>This is another <b>summary</b> element inside a <b>details</b> element nested inside another <b>details</b> element.</summary>
   <div>This content started out hidden because its <b>details</b> element did <u>not</u> include the <b>open</b> attribute.</div>

<h2>The <button disabled> more </button> and <button disabled> less </button> buttons, however, affect the page elements immediately <i>preceding</i> them:</h2>

<div>
 <span>Right now you want to see </span> <span>more, but later you'll change your mind and want to see </span><button onclick="button_toggle(this)">more</button><span>.</span>
</div>

<hr>
<h2>
Like <button disabled> more </button>, the <button disabled> ... </button> button exposes the page element immediately preceding it.
<br>
Unlike <button disabled> more </button>, however, <button disabled> ... </button> hides itself. Once you click it, there's no going back:</h2>

<div>
 <span>The danger is that once you've seen something</span><span>, you cannot <u>un</u>see it.</span>
 <button onclick="button_toggle(this)">...</button>
</div>

</body>
